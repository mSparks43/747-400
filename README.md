# Boeing 747-400

## Major Overhaul of the Laminar Boeing 747-400

Thank you all for your support! This overhaul is now at the "experimental" version 1 stage. Still more todo but now has enough flight test hours under its belt to be a stable daily driver for your short and long haul needs.

**Is the 747 free?**

Yes! Of course! This project is an open source project, consisting of developers gathering from all over the world wanting to create a 747.

**What happened to the YesAviation 747?**

The YesAviation team now goes under another name, and is developing another 747 somewhere else. Everyone sends a big thank you to the former team, and wish them good luck in their endeavors.

**What are the differences between the default 747, and the Sparky 747?**

This 747 currently includes new FMOD sounds done by FT+Sim, new systems and FMC, three variants of engines coming soon, a new UV map for livery creators, and many more big changes in the future.
The github repository contains the latest versions, including the LCF model variant by Lee_Hyeon_Seo (with permission) with the existing improvements, check out the working his [A340 developements](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/203381-3d-cockpit-for-a340/&)

Custom sounds from [FTSim+](https://k-akai.blogspot.com/) (with permission)

The general concept is to bring the aircraft as close to the real version as is achievable, please refer to original 747-400 material such as the widely distributed FCOM for details on how the aircraft functions.

**How did you acheive such high framerates?**

This overhaul converts all the existing 744 systems, along with all the numerous additions from XLua, which is single threaded and directly impacts X-Plane framerates, to XTLua, a fork of XLua which maintains general compatibility with XLua, but takes all the aircraft systems off the X-Plane flight simulation thread and makes full use of a modern multithreaded operating system (use Linux for the best results, but Microsoft Windows and macOS are also supported).

XTlua is described in more detail [here](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/209883-xtlua-parallel-lua-for-complex-aircraft-systems/)

XTlua source is [here](https://github.com/mSparks43/XLua/tree/xTLua)

**How can I contribute**

Please use the [github issue page](https://github.com/mSparks43/747-400/issues) if you find a problem. If your issue is already listed please add your details, problems that can be recreated are generally fixed quickly.

### Installation
Just extract the zip to your aircraft folder, with some caveats:

Windows users:
You need to manually install C++ support

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13523

And multithreading support

https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe (aka.ms is a microsoft domain - linked from https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

In order to use this aircraft

### Troubleshooting

**What is the black console window that opens when I start the plane** Don't close it. The console window is part of the systems monitoring and will give important information needed to report issues for example if the plane crashes to desktop. This and the X-Plane Log.txt are the two primary tools for investigating issues.

**All my cockpit is black and I can't click anything** Windows users: Please install the installers linked above. Also check that the plugins/xtlua/64/win.xpl extracted correctly. Some users have reported their antivirus blocking it from being extracted. Please send an angry email to your antivirus provider along with a copy of the file if you have your time wasted by this.

**Why is my FMC blank** certain controllers have their switches automatically bound to avionics power, if these are off it turns off the avionics needed by the FMC, either switch on the switch on your controller, or bind a key to "avionics on" and use that to bring the FMC to life

**Why can't I move** The aircraft brakes require hydraulic pressure to function, to prevent the aircraft rolling away before the hydraulics are pressurised the wheels are fitted with chocks when starting cold and dark, remove the from the ground services menu in one of the FMCs.

Additionally, the break lever and X-Plane breaks are now seperated, there is a new command to engage the breaks by lifting the parking break lever.

**Why are my screens half black** IRS alignment cannot complete until you set the IRS position in the FMC. (INIT REF -> POS -> R4 to copy GPS position, R5 to enter it into current position.
